            "description":  "The African Gray Parrot is the largest of the African parrots and is the greatest talking parrot. The color is sooty gray with a pale gray rump, bright red tail, a black bill, and a white area around the yellow eye. The parrot√≠s bill is highly adaptable. In addition to crushing nuts and preening, it serves as a third foot when moving about treetops. The feet are unique, in that the two outer toes point backward in opposition to the two inner toes, which point forward (zygodactilous). This enables them to manipulate objects, resulting in a manual dexterity that is unsurpassed in any other group of birds. They have even shown a tendency to be right-footed or left-footed.",
